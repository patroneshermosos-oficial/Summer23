# BP Summer 

Welcome to the BP Summer23 repository! This folder documents my work and advancements during my participation in the BP summer program. During this period, I am focusing on establishing relationships between schools in Aguascalientes that have girls in different age groups. Additionally, I am working on creating guidelines for a new course that can be developed and delivered by girls collaborating with BP.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of my project are:

1. **Building School Relationships**: Establish meaningful connections and partnerships with schools in Aguascalientes to promote and enhance girls' participation in STEM education across different age groups.

2. **Course Development Guidelines**: Create a comprehensive guideline for developing a new course that can be delivered by girls collaborating with BP, helping them in their process as instructors and mentors.
