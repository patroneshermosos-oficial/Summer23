Hello! My name is Mar√≠a Fernanda Zavala L√≥pez, and I'm from Aguascalientes, Mexico. I have a background in programming, having studied technical programming in high school, and recently completing my degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. I'm about to start a specialization in Software Quality. Currently, I work as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer since May 2022.

I've been involved with Beautiful Patterns since April 2021, contributing to the creation of mini-courses on topics like GitHub, Design Thinking, and Cryptocurrency. I also had the opportunity to organize the winter bootcamp at Universidad Panamericana in January 2023.

One of my main motivations is to create initiatives that empower girls and women to explore the world of science without feeling intimidated, and to show them that it's within their reach. Apart from my passion for technology and education, I'm also a violinist and actively participate in my university's classical ensemble and string quartet. I'm proud to serve as the president of the Panamericana ACM-W student chapter, promoting women in engineering.

I'm excited to be part of this summer project at MIT and look forward to contributing my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to connect!


## üîé About Beautiful Patterns

Beautiful Patterns is an interdisciplinary initiative that aims to address social and technological challenges in STEM education for women, especially in the field of computing in a rapidly evolving world. Our goal is to promote active participation of women in these areas, fostering interest, confidence, and equitable access to opportunities. Through various activities and resources, Beautiful Patterns seeks to inspire and support girls interested in STEM by providing a space where they can explore their passions, develop relevant skills, and connect with a community of like-minded individuals. We believe in the importance of creating a more equitable society where women have balanced representation and meaningful influence in the world of technology.

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª About my work this summer

During this summer, I have been involved in various projects that have allowed me to contribute to the fields of marketing analysis and community engagement. One of my key contributions has been the development of an automated system using AutoGPT for marketing analysis, which has helped in gathering valuable insights and data to support decision-making processes. This involved training the model to analyze market trends, customer behavior, and competitor strategies, providing actionable recommendations for business growth.

In addition, I have been working on creating a comprehensive guide for developing mini-courses as part of the Beautiful Patterns initiative. This guide aims to empower girls and women interested in STEM fields by providing them with a step-by-step process to design and deliver engaging and informative mini-courses. It covers aspects such as content creation, visual design, effective teaching methodologies, and evaluation techniques. By equipping aspiring instructors with these resources, we aim to foster their confidence and enable them to share their knowledge and passion with others.

Overall, my work this summer has focused on leveraging technology and educational initiatives to promote inclusivity and empowerment in STEM. Through marketing analysis and the development of educational resources, I strive to contribute to creating a more equitable and accessible environment for girls and women in these fields.
